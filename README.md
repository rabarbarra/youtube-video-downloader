### YouTube Video Downloader

This Python script downloads videos from YouTube and saves them in the folder of my choice. I wrote it mainly to be able to watch videos while offline (without having to buy YouTube Premium :P).
If you want to run it on your machine:
1. Install pytube library first. In your terminal, run this command:

`pip install pytube`

2. Replace my path with the path to the folder where you would like to save your downloaded videos.

Enjoy!
